## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Reporting Channel:**  
Please report security issues through GitHub: https://github.com/itsjuoum/GIAEConnect/security/advisories/new

**Before Reporting:**  
1. Ensure you're using the latest version
2. Check if a newer patch version already exists that might contain the fix

**Response Process:**  
  - Fix will be included in the next scheduled release
  - Public disclosure occurs after patch deployment

**Unaccepted Reports:**  
- Unsupported versions
- Outdated minor/patch versions where a fixed version exists
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies I don't maintain
- Theoretical issues without demonstrated exploitability
